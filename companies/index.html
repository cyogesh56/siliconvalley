							Twitter is a microblogging and social networking service where users post and interact with messages known as “tweets” Twitter was created in March 2006 by Jack Dorsey, Noah Glass, Biz Stone, and Evan Williams, with Jack Dorsey is sitting as CEO currently. It is based in San Francisco, California and has more than 25 offices around the world.<br><br>Twitter business model is similar to the business model of other social networks. Users create a profile and then those users can post short status updates as well as share videos, images, and links. They can also follow other users and view the tweets of the accounts they choose to follow. Twitter has also began shifting its focus to video content and shares revenue with content creators (70% goes to the content creators, the rest goes to Twitter). It also wants to get exclusive digital rights to big events like NFL games, political debates, award ceremonies, etc. to enhance its business model. From a value proposition, Twitter offers its various stakeholders benefits such as user benefits, advertiser benefits, and data partner benefits. <br><br>In terms of innovation resources and investments, Twitter uses a multitude of ways to stay innovative. From an internal perspective, Twitter puts together Hackathons twice a year where employees can give 100% of their time during the Hackathons. They can partner with external groups during this time as well. During times when a Hackathon is not going on, innovation still occurs as each team has its own “innovation team/champion” as well as a governing body. This allows every team to put forth new ideas and have a team that focuses on evaluation for continuing execution. In terms of external innovation, Twitter&rsquo;s big focus is pulling ideas from users themselves, especially those users who are verified as an account of public interest by Twitter. To continue to move new ideas from idea to production, Twitter utilizes an internal version of their app, nicknamed DogFood. Everyone at Twitter then has the opportunity to use the new features and give feedback.<br><br>For external innovation, Twitter uses the same methods we see from companies and firms throughout the US with partnerships with colleges and other incubators. Each agreement comes with NDAs and SOWs so Twitter retains ownership of all developed material.<br>

							Google is a multinational, publicly-traded organization built around the company&rsquo;s hugely popular search engine. Google&rsquo;s other enterprises include internet analytics, cloud computing, advertising technologies, and web app, browser, and operating system development. Google was founded in 1998 by Larry Page and Sergrey Brin.<br><br>Google&rsquo;s business strategy and model revolves around the idea that by providing free services to their users, people will continue to use the services as well as bring advertisers with them. By having their revenue come from advertisers who are interested in reaching out to the online users who use the services, internet users never have to incur a fee to resulting in more and more users flocking to Google. To help advertisers, Google helps them create text-based ads through Google Adwords, a self-serve auction based advertising program. Most advertisers pay Google on a Cost per Click (CPC) basis. This means advertisers pay Google whenever users click on their ads. To help advertisers extend their ad campaigns to more of the Google users, Google created its AdSense program where companies are allowed to generate ad revenue on their own and Google only got one-third of the revenue generated. <br><br>All innovation from Google comes from its North Star. The idea of ensuring product excellence when comparing their benchmark products against competitors and the idea that it is an incentive to help others reach their goals. Google continues to innovate from the product perspective to this day behind the idea of a “Garage Mindset”. All employees need to understand the why vs. the how for each improvement of current products and new, out of the box ideas. This helps foster a workplace environment where innovation is at the lead. Google has three key points when it comes to bringing in innovative ideas. First, is to focus on the user. Google collects a lot of user feedback and incorporates ideas into products as they know having user support for updates and new products is one of the key driving forces to successful adoption. Second, Google encourages all employees to think 10X. By this they mean, whatever idea is thought of to expand on it a multiple of ten times. This helps the company to push the limit of what can be done and allows for very adventurous ideas to rise up, gain traction, and become new products or features. The third point may be Google&rsquo;s biggest advantage over other companies. They give their employees the freedom to innovate. This is the foundation of their culture. This can be seen from varying angles. Google was the first company to implement the 20% policy, where employees can give 20% of their time to work on any work they feel passionate about. Alongside the 20% policy, Google has an innovation space called Area 120, which is a virtual as well as a physical presence. Area 120 is an internal incubator of sorts where new innovative ideas can get dedicated resources to assist in building out the idea with structured milestones built in. This allows the ideas to graduate through different tiers with increasing levels of resource allocation. The idea of failing fast and iterate off of the failure also helps them push new products through the innovation pipeline quickly. Google wants to present failures, learn from it, celebrate the failure, and continue to innovate. This can be seen in a new world example of the transition from Google Glass to Google Cardboard. The success of Google Cardboard would not have happened with the failure of Google Glass.<br>

							Outward is a 3 -D imaging and augmented reality platform for the home furnishings and décor industry. The company is based in San Jose, California. With over 170 employees, the company was founded by Clarence Chui in October 2012. In 2017, William and Sonoma announced acquisition of Otward,Inc that will enable Outward,Inc to extend Its high-touch customer service platform and further transform the shopping experience for home furnishings with digital Technology<br><br>Outward came into existence trying to bridge the gap to make visual merchandising process easier for customers and by taking advantage of the latest technological developments.Even though Outward is acquired by William and Sonoma, they operate independently allowing flexibility and freedom and at the same time tap into customer experience. The product vision and experience is moulded by people with strong creative background and folks from product and engineering division. <br><br>Outward strives to create balance in quality and creative expression yet maintaining high volume digital asset creation and also by being focussed on both online and offline customer experience. <br><br>One of the important points the CEO spoke about is how they don't pursue areas where there is a huge number of people looking at the fundamental technologies and world class expertise, hence Outwards approach to innovation is to define a completely different problem,go a different tangent with what the market is working on and is pursuing. Key factor to the success of Outward is how they acquired the deep knowledge of the traditional retail business and embracing luck.<br>

							Linkedin is professional social networking service that operates via a mobile app or website. Their CEO is Jeff Weiner and was founded in 2003, headquarters is located in Mountain View, CA., current employee count is 14,000 and as of June 2019, LinkedIn had 630 million registered members in 200 countries. <br><br>On June 13, 2016, Microsoft announced that it would acquire LinkedIn for $196 a share, a total value of $26.2 billion. Microsoft would allow LinkedIn to "retain its distinct brand, culture and independence", with Weiner to remain as CEO, who would then report to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. Analysts believed Microsoft saw the opportunity to integrate LinkedIn with its Office product suite to help better integrate the professional network system with its products. The deal was completed on December 8, 2016 [1]. <br><br>When we talk about LinkedIn we will be talking about their Market space, there is an Enterprise side that consist of HR and more, but in this analysis it&rsquo;ll be solely on the market side. Researchers at Linkedin have visibility across the company and teams are constructed of product owners, engineers, data scientists, marking professional and currently there&rsquo;s 200 designers with approximately 40 researchers. The number of years a employee stays at LinkedIn is an average of 4 years but they allow for employees to rotate to other departments, to not get burned out, and allow them to allocate 20% of their time to help with innovational ideas/projects. Hackathon is one outlet that they host annually where employees can propose an idea and other resource can work on this idea. There are N days that consists of one Friday in the month where its time back to the employees to work on another project, propose an idea or simply take the day off. There is even a Patent program that engineers are given a patent in their name for the code or development they created.<br><br>LinkedIn&rsquo;s product innovation is driven by the business objectives, the business will have goals set and based on those goals there&rsquo;s features, products and such that roll up and there&rsquo;s different input and outputs that are approved and funded for implementation. Voice of the member is utilized, which is an aggregated marketed tool, collect information and looking through that data to analysis some weak areas, or from their research they&rsquo;ll flag items that need more investigation. Product has to be involved in the research so that they can hear the feedback from the research that is being conducted. <br><br>QR Code was not on a product roadmap and that feature was introduced by watching people exchange their phones and manually enter their names so they can connect on LinkedIn. The product manager and researcher thought this would be great feature to introduce in the Search field and being that the product manager is from China, utilizes WeChat, the decision was to use QR Codes. Another feature that was recently deployed is Event, that took a year and half to build out and partnered with Microsoft to be in the conferences to demo their MVP and pilot launched to gather research. They have different approaches when before implementation, such as a company release, small subset of accounts and ten or twenty percent. <br>

							A consumer facing software startup located in San Francisco, founded in 2017 and recently incorporated in Jan 2019. The CEO is Nick Ionita who oversees approximately 11 employees and a handful of customers who currently secured seed money with a goal to secure Series A funding by 2020. <br><br>This idea originated when the CEO, Nick Ionita, and his cofounder came up with a thesis and felt that résumés and job descriptions are broken, people don&rsquo;t write them well and they&rsquo;re artifacts of the industrial era. Everything today is knowledge work, résumés are pointed to getting a job and doesn't convey the potential. Job descriptions are poorly written when it should be what the business needs, not who knows how to use Microsoft Office. <br><br>The thesis started off with the mindset that the data needed to be better, and if you can look at people in the workspace the same way like this component parts then you can build a better system for matching people opportunity instead of using titles. Their model is to sell the head of HR, to CEOs, CFO and head of business Units and their business problem their effectively solving is Retention, if you can help people to find paths to a new opportunity and fell like their progressing they&rsquo;ll stay longer in the company. <br><br>The product roadmap, for building an enterprise system, they release once a week but doesn't touch critical process. Everything is a unit of opportunity and everything that you build needs to be useable by the greatest number of customers and the only way to make this cheaper everything has to be reusable. <br>This product, not being a mature one yet, needs to see real data to be able to build a product around and likes to set things out like a theme and a strategy. Its very important that everyone in the company understand that strategy and why they&rsquo;re picking certain changes, it gets really hard to keep people on board when they can&rsquo;t understand the strategy and how that&rsquo;s tracking to the roadmap, so he communicates these on a monthly sprint call. <br><br>They want to be an operating system for resourcing and think this starts with all the opportunities and employees have to live in the same system, its a supply and demand comparison exercise that&rsquo;ll be done. There is 2 kind of products, one is matching them to the job (transactional exercise) and the other is pathing/compounding which is showing someone what they could be ultimately. An analogy of this could be like in Experian.com users are given scenarios of what to do to get a higher credit score rate, i.e paying off 1500 a month to bills in the next 5 months and achieve a 800 score. <br>So their pitch is, for management, “who is here who can do this job” and for employees, “what can i be, what can i do next” and they continues to build this 10 year road map with a northstar ahead.<br><br>“Titles are proxies for things”&nbsp;<br>

							Uber Technologies, Inc. is an American multinational transportation network company offering services that include peer-to-peer ridesharing, ride service hailing, food delivery, and a bicycle-sharing system. The company is based in San Francisco and has operations in over 785 metropolitan areas worldwide.<br><br>Ubers approach to disruptive innovation starts with Understanding the problem, distill the problem to simple form resulting in solutions that are simple. <br><br>At UBER pursuing innovative ideas is tied to ROI, employees or leadership comes up with a brilliant idea, which when seen from a product perspective or an engineering perspective is great, although the question that rises is what is the ROI in allocating resources to get the idea done, the key metrics. <br><br>At UBER, when a new feature comes out, a product manager writes a document called the PRD or Product Revenue Document. Since UBER is a large organisation, there are a lot of features that are coming out in their products, hence the PRD document is shared with everyone who is involved with the feature and responsible for , for example from taxes to the more ram to the finance teams, so that everyone is aware of the impact. Innovative ideas at UBER is dependent on what is the problem you are trying to solve and what are the KPIs you really are trying to drive from. <br><br>Ubers approach to innovation is they pursue tangential kind of ideas in an incubator that is set up within Uber. To take the idea ahead funding is available for very fascinating ideas like the flying taxis, which sounds like science fiction. Some of the products Uber is strategically investing on is UBER freight to transport goods from one place to another, JUMP bikes. Although the idea is to have these products separated from the mainstream Uber app. <br><br>At Uber, for innovation 20% of employee time is spent on working on innovative ideas , which is called the engineering excellence.<br>
